            A cop sees him go flying past so chases him and pulls him over.
            The cop goes up to the car and asks the man, 
            "Are you aware of how fast you were going, sir?"
            The man replies, "Yes I am. I'm trying to escape a robbery I got involved in."
            The cop looks at him disbelievingly and asks him, "Were you the one being robbed, sir?"
            The man casually replies, "Oh no, I was the one who committed the robbery. I was escaping."
            The cop is shocked that the man has admitted this so freely.
            He says, "So you're telling me you were speeding...AND committed a robbery?"
            "Oh yes," replies the man calmly. "I have all the loot in the back."
            The cop is now starting to get angry and says, "Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me" 
            as he reaches into the window to take the car keys out of the ignition.
            The man shouts, "Don't do that! I'm afraid that you'll find the gun in my glove compartment!"
            At this, the cop pulls his hand out of the window and says, "Wait here" as he returns to his car and calls for backup. 
            Soon there are cars, cops and helicopters all over, everywhere you look. 
            The man is quickly dragged out of his car, handcuffed and taken towards a cop car. 
            However, just before he is put in the car and taken away a cop walks up to him and says, 
            while pointing at the cop that pulled him over, "Sir, this officer tells us that you had committed a robbery, 
            had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. 
            However, we didn't find any of these things in your car." 
            The man replies, "Yeah, and I bet that liar said I was speeding too!"

                You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
                Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
                Looking out for another
                Anyone will do

Þegar "float" skipunin er notuð þá missir vafrinn tökin á skipulaginu og allt fer á flot. Skoðum betri lausnir í næsta verkhluta.
